Deep down, we all yearn to be seen and heard. We strive to become an authority figure, whether it is as the CEO of a big organization, or the cherished father of a child. But what makes a meaningful and inspiring leader? And what do you need to become an everyday leader, as **Drew Dudley** talks about in his [TED Talk about everyday leadership](http://www.ted.com/talks/drew_dudley_everyday_leadership)?

# 1. Ask questions

> *“Of course I follow the people, am I not their leader?”*

The quote above as well as the TED talk both start with a question. That is no coincidence.

> *A meaningful leader is not afraid to ask meaningful questions, or admit that they don’t know all the answers.*

A meaningful leader realizes that in order to be part of something bigger than yourself, you have to surround yourself with people that know more than you on a subject and you’re not afraid to admit it, or listen to other’s advice or opinions.

A meaningful leader realizes that you don’t have to know it all.

# 2. Listen and react

There has been a lot of emphasis lately on the importance of listening, and it continues to be one of the most important skills of a meaningful leader.

> *But listening without action, is the same as not listening at all.*

A meaningful leader doesn’t only listen open-heartedly, they react and respond appropriately. They are not afraid to say *“I don’t know yet”*, or *“I’ll have to think about it”*, as they realize immediate action is often only addressing a symptom that is part of a bigger problem, and that a longterm solution requires careful consideration before taking action.

A meaningful leader takes time to think about what was said before responding, and she takes multiple viewpoints and perspectives into consideration before acting with confidence.

A meaningful leader takes careful, well thought through action at the appropriate time, action that empowers and supports and which is well within the comfort zone of the followers.

# 3. Be congruent

Actions speak louder than words. Meaningful leadership is about saying what you do, and doing what you say. It’s about living and demonstrating integrity at all times.

> *What you **think**, what you **say**, and what you **do** must at all time be aligned in order to demonstrate meaningful leadership.*

People don’t do what you say, they do what you do. When you as a leader demonstrate integrity, you inspire people to follow you, rather than demanding their respect.

A meaningful leader understands that he teaches not knowledge and information, but values. And values can not be taught by words or be demanded, it is earned.

> Everyday leadership demands honesty and vulnerability, not knowledge and power.

A meaningful leader, whether it is the head of a big organization or the head of a household, is someone who lives in integrity, leading by example and inspiring, not demanding. A meaningful leader listens to the needs of his people and reacts thoughtfully, after careful consideration.

So what will it take for you to become a meaningful leader?
