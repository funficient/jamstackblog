It is filled with **practical advice** and **case studies** from real people who managed to successfully secure funding for their startup.

> *It’s a practical book filled with answers to all your startup funding questions.*

It covers all the important questions, like what funding *options* are available, *when* to look for funding, *what* you need in order to secure funding and even *where* to find funding options and connect with possible investors.

## The writing style

It is an easy to read book written in a conversational style, written from practical experience and personal success stories from a range of different industries, including medical startups, technology- and outdoor ski gear startups.

It contains a wealth of supporting diagrams and links to resources on the web, making it a rich and interesting reading experience.

# I like, I wish, I wonder…

As a pragmatist, I simply loved the practicality of the advice and the inclusion of real stories from real people. It starts with bursting the bubble for anyone thinking startup funding is easy, pointing out that all the success stories are written *after* the success, which immediately drew me in. I wasn’t disappointed until the very end.

Not ever having looked for funding myself and with an affinity of working with startups, this was a much needed resource to help me as advisor to entrepreneurs understand the challenges and needs of a business looking for funding.

The ***variety of industries*** and case studies were extremely helpful as from personal experience, I understand that when it involves human beings, it’s much more complex than one-size-fits-all answers to difficult questions. Having access to the experiences of different people in different situations were extremely insightful.

Each ***chapter follows logically on the next***, making the read easy to follow with questions being answered as they pop up. The end of each chapter is summarized with the key take-away points for the busy readers or more advanced investors.

The book doesn’t just tell you about the options available and how to approach an investor, it ***helps the business owner decide*** on a product mix and ***business model*** that would not only be valuable to an investor, but to the business owner himself. It certainly changed my mind on the business model I had in mind. It is filled with business advice to help entrepreneurs succeed.

Whether you are looking at funding or not, this is a very valuable read.

The only ***criticism*** I could find is the unfinished formatting with hard to read colors in certain sections. From a content point of view, and as a new entrepreneur, there was no question left unanswered in my mind after completing the book.
